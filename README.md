**My First Website**

This is my first website, the first website I built myself.I could say I am proud of me.

It might be ugly but it is beautiful to my eyes. :heart_eyes:
There are so many features that I'd like to add to this website:

* A responsive and dynamic nav bar
* More images and videos
* A contact list

This table represents the time frame I give myself to implement all the features:


|Features   |Timeframe   |
|-----------|------------|
| nav bar   | 4 days     |
| images    | 2 days     |
| contact   | 3 days     |
