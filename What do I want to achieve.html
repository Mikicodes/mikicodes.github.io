	<p id="what1"> There are so many things that I would like to achieve but I will start with what I would like to achieve at the end of this program. <br><br>I intend to start a software company and envision to grow it to a unicorn in Africa and in the world. Thus, I am looking at achieving financial freedom <br> I am keen on education for the youth and I love teaching and I intend to set up a school to empower the youth with skills that will help them make an impact. <br><br>I am a music fan and I also feel like the african music industry and myself have taken advantage of the african artists. There is much to be done to give the artist the opportunity to live off their talents and that is an issue I would like to tackle.</p>
