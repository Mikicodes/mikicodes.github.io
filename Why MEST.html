		I have always admired business executives as they seemed to be the kind of people I wanted to be: a successful person. All I actually wanted was to be the guy in the neighbourhood known for his riches. However, I came to realize that there was much more in life than just having a big house. I came to realize that there are problems to be solved, there are lives to be changed and there are hearts and minds to be inspired. And that is what entrepreneurs like Elon Musk, Mark zuckerberg have been doing and I believe I have the heart and the drive to follow their steps.

		<h3>
			Why MEST?
		</h3>
		After I knew what I really wanted to do, I asked myself how I was going to achieve that.<br> I started with a small business selling african styled shirts. But along the road, I felt like that was not enough for the ambitions I had. I got the chance to work for a start up and I got exposed to technology and what it has to offer. I was amazed and I then decided to work in the technology space. I looked online for programs where I could be taught programming and build a project myself.<br>
		One day, while walking  around East Legon, I came across Meltwater Entrepreneurial School of Technology and I rapidly picked up the website which I explored and had the opportunity to see all the great things that was doing with young smart africans from different countries. And I applied. <br>
		I applied because I knew MEST would give me the skills to be a better an entrepreneur. I also applied to MEST because of the network that it could provide me. Having the possibility to be around people from 4 different countries was to me very valuable. The third reason is the funding that is provided to you to help you kickstart your entrepreneurial journey. At the end of the program, one mignt not get the funding but will gain unvaluable benefits from it.
